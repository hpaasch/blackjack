The game is started by running main.blackjack.py

Creation of a deck, dealing of cards and valuing of cards is in deck.py.
I used the product function from the itertools module. This is really simplified
the code for looping thru the rank and suit to create all possible combos.

The playing out of each hand is in hand.py.

The player.py doesn't do a lot in the Normal Mode of the homework. It assumes each
player shows up with $100. I'd like to attempt the Hard Mode portions, and so
I'm intentionally preserving a bare-bones Player class on the theory that it
builds out during the Hard Mode.
