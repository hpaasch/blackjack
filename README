The game is started by running main_blackjack.py.

deck.py creates a base deck, delivers a shuffled deck and delivers cards.
I used the product function from the itertools module. This really simplified
the code for looping thru the rank and suit to create all possible combos. After
running into trouble with my early drafts, I started my rebuilding at deck.py
because it doesn't import from any other classes.

hand.py takes the initial deal, values cards and takes additional cards. This
was the second phase of my rebuilding, because it imports only from Deck.

player.py creates one hand for the player and one hand for the dealer, and then
plays out each. This was the third phase of my rebuilding, and it takes imports
from both Deck and Hand.

main_blackjack.py launches the game and plays out the player's $100 bank.
This was the final part of the rebuilding.

(There are a number of files in the project that turn out to be extraneous.
Please ignore them.)

NOTE: I tested Ace logic to be sure it would pass should two Aces be dealt. that
test is visible on one of the player.py commits, with a message to that effect.

ALSO NOTE: My Normal Mode does include the optional player bank, but nothing
from Hard or Nightmare modes.
