The game is started by running main_blackjack.py.

deck.py creates a base deck, delivers a shuffled deck and delivers cards.
I used the product function from the itertools module. This really simplified
the code for looping thru the rank and suit to create all possible combos. After
running into trouble with my early drafts, I started my rebuilding at deck.py
because it doesn't import from any other classes.

hand.py takes the initial deal, values cards and takes additional cards. This
was the second phase of my rebuilding, because it imports only from Deck.

player.py creates one hand for the player and one hand for the dealer, and then
plays out each. This was the third phase of my rebuilding, and it takes imports
from both Deck and Hand.

main_blackjack.py launches the game, announces a winner and invites the player
to go another round. This was the final part of the rebuilding.
